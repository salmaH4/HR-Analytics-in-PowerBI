# HR-Analytics-in-PowerBI

## A Brief Introduction:
This dashboard focuses on importing, analyzing and visualizing Human Resources data using Power BI. I carried out exploratory data analysis and used DAX and measures to help build powerful visualizations diving deeper into attrition and what factors impact attrition. This analysis will help the organization determine what action they will need to take to retain more employees.


## Data Modeling
In this dataset I used a snowflake schema as it's a complex data structure with multiple relationships between the tables
- I imported the csv files and connected them in the model view

## Recommendations for HR to solve their buisness problems:
- For people with low manager ating, the HR should make a plan and discuss it with them in a meeting to improve their performance
- The frequent travelers for the company have the highest attrition rate. So the HR will need to review the travel requirements policy and survey the employees' feelings around the travel frequency
